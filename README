This is a collection of standalone OpenMax IL components for SH-Mobile,
using the Bellagio OpenMax IL project framework.

Installation
------------

This source archive uses the GNU autotools to build. Ensure that the standard GNU
build environment is available, including autoconf, automake, pkg-config.

To build:

autoreconf -vif
./configure
make
make install

Then register the resulting OpenMax IL components on the SH-Mobile host:

$ omxil-bellagio-register

Testing
-------

To test the audio components, use the omxsh-decode-audio tool. This is installed
when you do 'make install'.

Playback to an ALSA sound device:

$ omxsh-decode-audio testfile.mp3

$ omxsh-decode-audio testfile.aac

Decode to a file:

$ omxsh-decode-audio -o /tmp/testfile.raw testfile.mp3

$ omxsh-decode-audio -o /tmp/testfile.raw testfile.aac

When decoding audio to a file, the output will be written in the following raw PCM format:

Sample Size    : 16-bit (2 bytes)
Sample Encoding: signed (2's complement)
Channels       : 2
Sample Rate    : 44100

It can be played back with a command such as the following (using 'play' on a host
with sox installed):

$  play -s -2 -c2 -r44100 testfile.raw
